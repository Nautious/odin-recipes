    <h6>A plate of scrambled eggs</h6>
    <p>
        A classic American breakfast dish that is not only <strong>simple</strong> to make <em>but also</em> ready to eat in less than <strong>5 minutes!</strong> To get started, this is what you'll need:
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Milk or water</strong> if you like your eggs creamy</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong> of your choice to help keep the eggs from sticking; you may also use butter for a richer flavour</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack your eggs into a bowl</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs using a fork or a whisk, until the yolks and egg whites have been blended</li>
        <li>Turn your stove on to low to medium-low heat</li>
        <li>Heat your pan with your chosen oil or butter for 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add your beaten eggs to the pan and quickly stir the mixture around with a spatula and collect the forming curds into a pile</li>
        <li>The eggs are ready once the eggs are no longer runny, but still moist; move onto plate and add your seasoning, done!</li>
    </ol>
